# Hacker-Man
Hacker Man is a fun, fictional project simulating a "hacking" experience. The interface allows users to enter a target, select specific "hacks" like Facebook and Instagram, and initiate the hacking sequence. This project is purely for entertainment purposes and doesn't perform any real hacking activities.
